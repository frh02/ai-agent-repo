# LangGraph Blog Refiner

LangGraph Blog Refiner is an AI-powered tool that refines and improves blog posts from Medium using a multi-step agent loop built with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and LangChain. This project reads a Medium article, generates a refined version, and iteratively improves it through a reflection loop.

- ‚úÖ Stops automatically after a number of iterations or a condition is met.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point and orchestration logic using LangGraph.
- `chains.py`: Defines the generation and reflection chains.
- `medium_utils.py`: Utility to extract content from Medium articles.
